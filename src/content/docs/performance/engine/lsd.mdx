# Limited Slip Differential (LSD)

The stock E46 330 comes with an open differential. Adding a limited-slip differential is one of the most transformative performance upgrades.

## LSD Types

### Clutch-Type (Factory M3 Style)
- BMW E46 M3 3.62 LSD (direct swap into 330 housing with adapter)
- Smooth engagement, predictable behavior
- Requires periodic fluid changes with LSD additive

### Helical/Torsen
- **Quaife ATB**: Torque-biasing, no clutch packs, maintenance-free
- **Wavetrac**: Improved helical design, works under light loads
- Smooth operation, no wear items

### Welded/Spool
- Budget option: weld the spider gears
- Not recommended for street use (tire chirping in turns)
- Track/drift use only

## Gear Ratio Options
- Stock 330i: 3.07:1
- Stock 330Ci manual: 3.07:1
- Available ratios: 3.07, 3.15, 3.23, 3.38, 3.46, 3.62, 3.73, 4.10
- Shorter ratios (higher number) = better acceleration, lower top speed

## Installation
- Requires removal of rear differential
- Swap center section or swap entire differential unit
- Refill with 75W-140 synthetic + LSD additive (clutch type)
