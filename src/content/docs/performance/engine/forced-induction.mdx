# Forced Induction

Forced induction is the most effective way to make significant power on the M54. Both supercharger and turbo kits are available.

## Supercharger Kits

### ESS Tuning VT1-535 (Centrifugal)
- Power: ~330 whp at 7 PSI
- Bolt-on kit, retains stock internals
- Progressive power delivery (more boost at higher RPM)
- Excellent reliability record on stock internals

### Active Autowerke (Centrifugal)
- Power: ~300-350 whp depending on configuration
- Well-established kit with good support

## Turbo Kits

### Custom Turbo Builds
- Power: 350-600+ whp depending on turbo size
- Requires custom manifold, piping, fuel system upgrades
- Popular turbos: Garrett GT35, Precision 6266, BorgWarner EFR

### Supporting Modifications for Forced Induction
- Upgraded fuel injectors (stock: 258cc, upgrade to 440cc+)
- Upgraded fuel pump (Walbro 255 or AEM 340)
- Upgraded intercooler
- Stronger valve springs (high boost)
- ARP head studs (high boost)
- Oil cooler
- Standalone ECU or custom DME tune

## Stock Internal Limits
- The M54B30 stock internals are generally reliable to ~350 whp
- Above 400 whp, consider forged pistons and rods
- Stock transmission (manual) handles ~400 whp with good clutch
