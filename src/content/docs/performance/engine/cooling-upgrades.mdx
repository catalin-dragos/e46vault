# Cooling Upgrades

The stock cooling system struggles under sustained track use or with forced induction. These upgrades ensure reliability.

## Aluminum Radiator
- **Mishimoto**: Direct-fit aluminum, 30%+ more capacity
- **CSF**: High-quality aluminum upgrade
- Recommended for any tracked or boosted car

## Oil Cooler
- **Mishimoto oil cooler kit**: Thermostatically controlled
- Essential for track use and forced induction
- Stock M54 oil temps can exceed 130°C on track

## Electric Fan Conversion
- Replace belt-driven fan clutch with electric fans
- Frees up ~5 hp at the crank
- Better cooling control at idle and low speed
- SPAL fans commonly used

## Additional Cooling
- **Coolant reroute**: Improves flow to hottest cylinders
- **Oil thermostat upgrade**: Opens earlier for better flow
- **Ducting**: Direct air to oil cooler and radiator
