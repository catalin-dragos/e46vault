# Intake Modifications

The M54 intake system is already well-designed. Gains from intake modifications alone are minimal (2-5 whp) but contribute to overall bolt-on gains.

## Cold Air Intake Options

- **K&N Drop-in Filter**: Simplest mod, reusable, 1-2 whp
- **aFe Stage 1**: Drop-in filter, no oiling required
- **AFE/Injen Short Ram**: Replaces airbox, louder intake note, 3-5 whp
- **Full cold air intake**: Routes to fender area for cold air, 3-7 whp

## Intake Boot / Silencer Delete

The stock intake boot contains a resonator/silencer. Removing it or replacing with a smooth silicone boot can improve throttle response marginally and adds intake sound.

## DISA Valve Delete/Upgrade

The DISA valve optimizes torque across the RPM range. Some delete it for simplicity on track cars, but keeping it functional provides better low-mid range torque.

## Notes
- Oiled filters (K&N) can contaminate the MAF sensor — use carefully
- Short ram intakes may actually lose power by ingesting hot engine bay air
- Cold air intakes perform best on track where sustained airflow matters
