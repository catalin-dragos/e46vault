# ECU Tuning

ECU tuning modifies the DME (engine control module) software to optimize ignition timing, fuel delivery, and rev limiter. On the M54, gains are modest but meaningful.

## Flash Tuning Options

- **Shark Injector / Tuning Suite**: Popular BMW-specific tuner, 10-15 whp with bolt-ons
- **Evolve Automotive**: Well-regarded tune for M54
- **Custom dyno tune**: Best results, requires tuner with M54 experience

## What a Tune Changes
- Ignition timing advance
- Fuel maps (richer under load, leaner at cruise)
- Rev limiter (stock: ~6,500 RPM, can raise to ~7,000)
- Speed limiter removal (stock: 128 mph / 155 mph)
- Throttle response mapping
- VANOS timing optimization

## Expected Gains
- Stock car + tune: 5-10 whp
- Full bolt-ons + tune: 15-20 whp over stock
- Tune is most effective with supporting mods (intake, exhaust, headers)

## Important Notes
- Tuning may void warranty
- 91+ octane fuel required for aggressive tunes
- Some tunes require specific hardware (headers, intake, etc.)
- Keep stock tune backup for dealer visits
