# Short Shift Kit & CDV Delete

Two of the best driver-feel modifications for manual transmission E46s.

## Short Shift Kit

Reduces shift throw by 20-40%, making shifts quicker and more precise.

### Options
- **UUC EVO3**: Premium quality, adjustable reduction
- **ZHP shift knob**: Factory weighted knob, improves feel
- **Turner Motorsport**: Good value option
- **CAE Ultra Shifter**: Ultimate precision, race-grade

### Installation
1. Remove center console trim
2. Remove shift boot and knob
3. Disconnect shift linkage at transmission
4. Remove stock shifter assembly
5. Install short shift kit following manufacturer instructions
6. Reassemble in reverse

## CDV (Clutch Delay Valve) Delete

The CDV is a hydraulic restrictor in the clutch line that slows clutch engagement for smoother shifts. Removing it gives direct, immediate clutch response.

### Procedure
1. Locate CDV on clutch hydraulic line (near transmission)
2. Remove CDV and replace with straight connector fitting
3. Bleed clutch system
4. Adjust to faster engagement — requires gentler pedal input initially
