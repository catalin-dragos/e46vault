# Exhaust Modifications

Exhaust modifications provide the most noticeable naturally aspirated gains and dramatically change the car's character.

## Exhaust Components

### Headers
- **Stock manifold**: Cast iron, restrictive
- **Supersprint stepped headers**: Best quality, 5-10 whp
- **OBX headers**: Budget option, fitment can be challenging

### Catalytic Converter Section
- **High-flow cats**: Retain emissions compliance, reduce restriction
- **Test pipes/cat delete**: Maximum flow, emissions non-compliant
- Gains: 5-10 whp from high-flow cats

### Cat-Back Exhaust
- **Supersprint**: Premium quality, multiple configurations
- **Borla**: Stainless steel, good sound
- **Magnaflow**: Budget-friendly, decent sound
- **Custom 2.5" mandrel-bent**: Best value for flow

## Sound Character
- Headers + high-flow cats + cat-back = significant sound increase
- The M54 inline-6 has a distinctive smooth exhaust note
- Resonator delete adds rasp; some prefer it, others don't
