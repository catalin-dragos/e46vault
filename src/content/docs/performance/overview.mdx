# Performance Overview

The M54B30 responds well to modifications, though gains from naturally aspirated bolt-ons are modest. The real performance potential lies in forced induction, chassis work, and driver development.

## Realistic Power Expectations

| Modification Level | Power (WHP) | Cost Range |
|-------------------|-------------|------------|
| Stock | ~195 whp | — |
| Full bolt-on NA | ~210–220 whp | $2,000–$4,000 |
| Tuned + bolt-ons | ~215–225 whp | $3,000–$5,000 |
| Supercharged | ~300–350 whp | $5,000–$8,000 |
| Turbo | ~350–500+ whp | $8,000–$15,000+ |

## Best Value Modifications

1. **Suspension** — Biggest impact on driving experience per dollar
2. **Tires** — The single biggest grip improvement
3. **Brake pads and fluid** — Essential for any performance driving
4. **Short shift kit + CDV delete** — Transforms the manual driving experience
5. **LSD** — Dramatically improves traction and cornering balance
