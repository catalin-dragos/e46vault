# Roll Bar / Cage

A roll bar or roll cage is required by most track organizations for competitive events and recommended for any regular track use.

## Roll Bar vs Roll Cage
- **Roll bar**: Behind front seats, bolted or welded, allows street use
- **Roll cage**: Full car, welded, dedicated track/race car

## Popular Options

### Roll Bars
- **Hard Motorsport**: Bolt-in, SCCA/NASA approved
- **Autopower**: Bolt-in, various configurations
- **Kirk Racing**: Custom options available

### Roll Cages
- **Custom fabricated**: Best fit, most expensive
- **Kirk Racing**: Weld-in cage kits
- **AutoPower**: Bolt-in cage (easier installation)

## Installation Notes
- Must be properly mounted to structural floor points
- Floor reinforcement plates required
- Padding on all bars within head-strike zone (required by all sanctioning bodies)
- Professional installation recommended for welded items
- Must be compatible with seat and harness setup
