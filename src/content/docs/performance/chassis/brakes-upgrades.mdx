# Performance Brakes

Upgraded brakes are essential for any car driven hard. The stock E46 330 brakes are adequate for street use but fade quickly on track.

## Progressive Upgrade Path

### Level 1: Pads and Fluid ($150-$300)
- High-performance pads: Hawk HPS 5.0, StopTech Sport
- High-temp fluid: Motul RBF600 or Castrol SRF
- Biggest improvement per dollar

### Level 2: Add Lines and Rotors ($400-$800)
- Stainless steel brake lines
- Slotted rotors (StopTech, DBA)
- Better pedal feel and heat management

### Level 3: Caliper Upgrade ($800-$2,000)
- E46 M3 caliper swap (4-piston fronts)
- Requires correct brackets and rotors
- Significant improvement in braking power

### Level 4: Big Brake Kit ($2,000-$5,000+)
- StopTech ST-40 or ST-60
- Brembo GT kit
- May require 18"+ wheels for clearance

## Track Day Essentials
- Fresh DOT 4 high-temp fluid before every event
- Inspect pads and rotors before every event
- Consider dedicated track pads (swap before/after)
- Brake ducting for endurance events
