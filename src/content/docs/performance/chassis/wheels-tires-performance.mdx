# Performance Wheels & Tires

Tires are the single most important grip component. The right wheel and tire combination transforms handling.

## Tire Categories

### Extreme Performance (100-200 treadwear)

## Recommended Performance Sizes
- 17x8 ET35 with 245/40R17 square — great track setup
- 18x9 ET42 with 255/35R18 square — aggressive street/track
- 18x9.5 ET35 with 265/35R18 square — maximum grip (may need fender work)

## Wheel Weight Matters
Every 1 lb of unsprung weight saved at the wheel = ~4 lbs of sprung weight equivalent. Lightweight wheels improve acceleration, braking, and ride quality.
