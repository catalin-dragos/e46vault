# Vacuum Leaks

Vacuum leaks are a common cause of rough idle, lean fault codes, and poor running on the M54 engine.

## Common Leak Sources

1. **Intake boot** (between MAF and throttle body): Cracks on underside
2. **CCV hoses**: Multiple rubber hoses that deteriorate
3. **DISA valve gasket**: O-ring deterioration
4. **Intake manifold gaskets**: Rubber gaskets shrink with age
5. **Oil filler cap**: Worn O-ring
6. **Valve cover gasket**: Can leak vacuum
7. **Brake booster hose**: Check valve and hose failure
8. **PCV valve/hoses**: Various vacuum connections

## Fault Codes
- P0171: System too lean (Bank 1)
- P0174: System too lean (Bank 2)
- Both codes often indicate vacuum leak

## Diagnosis
1. **Visual inspection**: Look for cracked hoses, damaged boots
2. **Smoke test**: Most effective method — introduces smoke into intake
3. **Propane/carb cleaner test**: Spray around suspected areas at idle, listen for RPM change
4. **Scan tool**: Monitor fuel trims — high positive trim indicates lean (vacuum leak)

## Prevention
- Replace intake boot and CCV hoses at 80-100k miles
- Use quality replacement parts (Continental, Rein)
