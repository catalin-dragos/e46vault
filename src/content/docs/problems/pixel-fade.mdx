# Instrument Cluster Pixel Fade

The E46 instrument cluster (IKE) and MID/radio displays suffer from pixel fade, where LCD segments become dim or invisible.

## Affected Displays
- **Instrument cluster**: Odometer, trip computer, gear indicator
- **MID (Multi-Information Display)**: Radio/HVAC info display
- **OBC (On-Board Computer)**: Some models

## Cause
The ribbon cable connections between the LCD and the circuit board use conductive adhesive that deteriorates with heat cycling.

## Repair Options

### DIY Ribbon Cable Repair
1. Remove instrument cluster (4 screws behind trim)
2. Disassemble cluster housing
3. Locate ribbon cable connections to LCD
4. Re-solder or replace ribbon cable
5. Reassemble and reinstall

### Professional Repair
- Send cluster to specialist (BBA Reman, Bavarian Restoration)
- LED backlight upgrade available at same time
- $100-200 for professional repair

### Replacement
- Used cluster from same model year and mileage
- Must be coded to vehicle (mileage programming requires dealer/specialist)
