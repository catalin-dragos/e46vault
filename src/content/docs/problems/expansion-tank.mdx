# Expansion Tank Cracking

The plastic expansion tank is one of the most common failure points. It develops hairline cracks from heat cycling that can suddenly fail catastrophically.

## Symptoms
- Low coolant warning light
- Coolant smell in engine bay
- White residue or staining on tank
- Visible cracks (often on seams or near cap)
- Sudden coolant loss / overheating

## Prevention
- Replace every 60,000 miles or with cooling system overhaul
- Inspect regularly for discoloration or swelling
- Keep coolant at correct concentration (50/50)

## Replacement
- Drain coolant to below tank level
- Disconnect hoses from tank
- Remove mounting bracket
- Install new tank
- Refill and bleed cooling system
