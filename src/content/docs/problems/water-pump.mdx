# Water Pump Failure

The M54 water pump is mechanical (belt-driven) with a plastic impeller that can crack or shed blades, causing loss of coolant circulation.

## Failure Modes
- **Impeller failure**: Plastic blades crack or separate from shaft
- **Bearing failure**: Pump shaft bearing wears, causing leak or noise
- **Seal leak**: Weep hole leak indicates internal seal failure
- **Complete failure**: No coolant circulation — rapid overheating

## Warning Signs
- Coolant leak from water pump weep hole
- Squealing or grinding noise from pump area
- Overheating at idle or low speed
- Temperature fluctuation

## Prevention
- Replace water pump every 60-80k miles with cooling system overhaul
- Stewart water pump (metal impeller) is recommended upgrade over OEM plastic
- Part: 11 53 1 437 040

## Note on Metal vs Plastic Impeller
- OEM pump has plastic impeller (weight/cost savings)
- Stewart water pump uses metal impeller — more durable
- Always replace pump with thermostat and hoses
