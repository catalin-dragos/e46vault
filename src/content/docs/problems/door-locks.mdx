# Door Lock Actuator Failure

The E46 door lock actuators fail with age, preventing doors from locking or unlocking with the central locking system.

## Symptoms
- One or more doors don't lock/unlock with key fob
- Clicking sound but door doesn't lock
- Door locks intermittently
- Ghost locking/unlocking

## Diagnosis
- Listen for actuator clicking when locking/unlocking
- If no click, actuator motor has failed
- If clicking but not locking, linkage may be disconnected

## Affected Doors
Most commonly affects front doors (more use cycles), but can happen on any door including trunk.

## Replacement
1. Remove door panel
2. Remove vapor barrier
3. Disconnect actuator electrical connector
4. Remove actuator mounting screws/rivets
5. Disconnect linkage rod
6. Install new actuator in reverse order
7. Test operation before reassembling door panel
