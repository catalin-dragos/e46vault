# Control Arm Wear

The front lower control arms are a known wear item on the E46. The bushings and ball joints are integrated into aluminum arms and cannot be replaced separately (OEM design).

## Symptoms
- Steering wheel vibration at highway speeds
- Clunking over bumps
- Vague or wandering steering
- Inner tire edge wear
- Failed alignment (can't achieve specs)

## When to Replace
- Every 80,000-100,000 miles typically
- Sooner if driving on rough roads
- Always replace in pairs (left and right)

## Recommended Parts
- **Lemförder**: OEM supplier, best quality
- **Meyle HD**: Heavy-duty aftermarket, good value
- **TRW**: Quality alternative

## Torque Specs
- Control arm to subframe: 90 Nm (torque at ride height)
- Ball joint to steering knuckle nut: 65 Nm (new self-locking nut)
- Alignment required after replacement
