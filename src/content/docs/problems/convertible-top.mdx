# Convertible Top Issues (330Ci Only)

The E46 convertible uses a hydraulic system to operate the soft top. Several components can fail with age.

## Common Issues

### Hydraulic Pump Motor
- Top operates slowly or stops mid-cycle
- Motor may run but no movement
- Check hydraulic fluid level first

### Hydraulic Cylinders
- Top won't fully open or close
- Leaking hydraulic fluid (red/brown stains on trunk area)
- One side operates faster than other

### Microswitch Failures
- Top stops at random positions
- Control module doesn't detect top position
- Safety interlock prevents operation

### Rear Window Issues
- Rear plastic window becomes cloudy/yellowed
- Window separates from fabric
- Zipper mechanism fails

## Hydraulic Fluid
- Type: BMW convertible top hydraulic fluid (or Pentosin CHF 11S)
- Check level at reservoir in trunk

## Emergency Manual Close
If hydraulics fail, there is a manual override:
1. Access manual override in trunk
2. Use provided Allen key to manually lower/raise top
3. See owner's manual for specific procedure
