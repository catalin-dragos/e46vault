# Rear Trailing Arm Bushing (RTAB) Wear

RTABs are one of the most common rear suspension wear items. When worn, they compromise rear-end stability.

## Symptoms
- Clunking from rear over bumps
- Rear end feels loose or wanders
- Excessive rear tire wear
- Failed rear alignment (can't set toe)
- Visible bushing deformation

## Diagnosis
1. Raise rear of vehicle
2. Visually inspect bushings for cracking or deformation
3. Try to move trailing arm by hand — any movement indicates wear
4. Check alignment specs — worn RTABs cause toe changes

## Repair
See the RTAB Replacement page in the Suspension section.
