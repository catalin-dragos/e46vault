# ABS Wheel Speed Sensor Failure

ABS wheel speed sensors fail due to heat, debris, and wire damage from their exposed location near the wheels.

## Symptoms
- ABS warning light
- DSC/traction control light
- Speedometer malfunction
- Loss of ABS function
- Loss of DSC function

## Diagnosis
1. Read fault codes to identify which sensor
2. Inspect sensor wiring for damage (common at wheel area)
3. Check sensor air gap and mounting
4. Test sensor resistance with multimeter (~1,000 ohms)

## Replacement
1. Unplug sensor connector (follow wire up)
2. Remove retaining bolt (8 Nm)
3. Pull sensor from knuckle/bearing carrier
4. Apply anti-seize to new sensor body
5. Install new sensor — torque to 8 Nm
6. Route wire away from moving parts
7. Clear fault codes with scan tool
