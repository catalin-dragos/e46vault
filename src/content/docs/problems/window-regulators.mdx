# Window Regulator Failure

Window regulators are arguably the most common failure point on the E46. The cable-driven design has an inherently limited lifespan.

## How It Fails
- Cable breaks or frays
- Cable slips off the drum
- Motor burns out (less common)
- Plastic guides crack

## Symptoms
- Window drops into door suddenly
- Grinding noise when operating window
- Window moves slowly or unevenly
- Window doesn't respond at all

## Which Windows Fail Most
1. Driver's front (most used)
2. Passenger front
3. Rear windows (less common)

## Repair
See the DIY: Window Regulator Replacement guide in the Maintenance section.

## Parts
- OEM regulators: ~$80-120 each
- Aftermarket (URO): ~$30-50 (shorter lifespan)
- Recommendation: OEM or Continental for longevity
