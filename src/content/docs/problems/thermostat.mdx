# Thermostat Failure

The thermostat regulates engine temperature by controlling coolant flow to the radiator. It's a critical cooling system component.

## Failure Modes

### Stuck Open (Most Common)
- Engine runs cooler than normal
- Heater produces lukewarm air
- Longer warm-up time
- Fault code: P0128
- Reduced fuel economy

### Stuck Closed (Dangerous)
- Engine overheats rapidly
- Temperature gauge goes to red
- Immediate engine damage risk
- Stop driving immediately!

## Replacement
The thermostat is located on the front of the engine block:
1. Drain coolant below thermostat level
2. Remove thermostat housing bolts (10 Nm)
3. Remove old thermostat and gasket
4. Install new thermostat with new gasket/O-ring
5. Refill and bleed cooling system

## Part Number
- Thermostat: 11 53 7 509 227 (Wahler OE, 97°C opening)
