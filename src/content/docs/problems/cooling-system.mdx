# Cooling System Failure

The E46 cooling system is the single most critical maintenance area. Every major component is made of plastic and has a finite lifespan.

## Why It Fails
- Expansion tank: Plastic becomes brittle with heat cycles
- Water pump impeller: Plastic impeller can crack or shed blades
- Thermostat: Fails open (runs cool) or closed (overheats)
- Radiator: Plastic end tanks crack
- Hoses: Rubber degrades over time, especially lower hose

## Warning Signs
- Temperature gauge fluctuation
- Coolant loss without visible leak
- Sweet smell from engine bay
- White residue on expansion tank
- Low coolant warning light
- Overheating at idle (fan clutch) or highway (thermostat/pump)

## Prevention
Replace the entire cooling system proactively every 60-80k miles. This is the single best preventive maintenance you can do.

## Cost of Failure
An overheated M54 can warp the aluminum cylinder head, requiring a head gasket replacement ($2,000+) or complete engine replacement.
