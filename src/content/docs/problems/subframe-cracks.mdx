# Rear Subframe Cracking

The E46 rear subframe mounting points can crack and separate from the unibody floor pan. This is a well-documented structural issue that affects all E46 models.

## Why It Happens
- Insufficient reinforcement at mounting points from factory
- Stress from suspension loads transmitted through subframe
- Exacerbated by aggressive driving, track use, or rough roads
- More common on higher mileage cars

## Warning Signs
- Clunking from rear under acceleration or braking
- Visible cracks in floor pan (check from inside and underneath)
- Cracking paint around subframe mount area
- Rear suspension misalignment
- Unusual tire wear patterns

## Inspection
1. Remove rear seat bottom
2. Pull back carpet/insulation
3. Inspect all 4 mounting points for cracks
4. Check from underneath as well
5. Look for spider cracks in seam sealer

## Repair Options
See the Subframe Reinforcement page in the Suspension section.
