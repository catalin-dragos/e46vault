# VANOS Seal Failure

The M54 dual-VANOS system uses Teflon seals that harden and wear over time, causing the system to lose oil pressure control over camshaft timing.

## Symptoms
- Rough idle, especially when cold
- Loss of low-end torque
- Rattling noise from front of engine on startup
- Fault codes: P0010, P0011, P0012, P0015, P1519
- Hesitation during acceleration
- Reduced fuel economy

## Diagnosis
- Scan for VANOS-related fault codes
- Listen for rattle on cold start (worse when cold)
- Test VANOS solenoids with INPA/ISTA
- Check oil level and condition (low oil worsens symptoms)

## Repair Options
1. **VANOS seal replacement (Beisan Systems kit)**: Most common fix, replace Teflon seals
2. **VANOS solenoid replacement**: If solenoids are faulty
3. **Complete VANOS rebuild**: If unit is severely worn

## Prevention
- Regular oil changes with quality oil
- Address symptoms early before unit is damaged
