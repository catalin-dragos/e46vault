# CCV Valve Failure

The Crankcase Ventilation (CCV) system recirculates blow-by gases from the crankcase back into the intake. The valve and hoses deteriorate with age.

## Symptoms
- Oil consumption increase
- Rough idle
- Oil in intake boot (remove boot and check)
- Whistling noise from engine
- Lean fault codes (P0171, P0174) due to vacuum leaks
- Oil leaks from valve cover or oil cap

## Diagnosis
1. Remove intake boot and check for oil accumulation
2. Inspect CCV hoses for cracks or collapse
3. Check for vacuum at oil cap (remove cap at idle — should have slight suction)
4. If cap blows off or no suction, CCV is likely failed

## Replacement
The CCV valve is located under the intake manifold, requiring manifold removal for access:
1. Remove intake manifold
2. Replace CCV valve and all associated hoses
3. Replace intake manifold gaskets
4. Reinstall manifold — torque bolts to 10 Nm
