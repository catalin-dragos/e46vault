# DISA Valve Failure

The DISA (Differentiated Intake System Actuator) valve controls a flap in the intake manifold that optimizes torque across the RPM range. The pin holding the flap can break, dropping metal into the engine.

## Critical Warning
If the DISA flap pin breaks, the metal flap can be ingested into the engine, causing catastrophic damage to pistons, valves, and cylinder walls.

## Symptoms
- Check engine light (P1523)
- Rattling or fluttering from intake manifold
- Loss of mid-range torque
- Rough running

## Diagnosis
1. Remove DISA valve from intake manifold
2. Inspect flap pin for wear or looseness
3. Check if flap moves freely
4. Look for metal debris in intake ports

## Prevention
- Inspect DISA flap pin at every major service
- Replace DISA valve preventively at 80-100k miles
- Aftermarket rebuilt units with upgraded pins available

## Part Number
- DISA valve: 11 61 7 544 805
