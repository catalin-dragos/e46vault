# Ignition Coil Failure

The M54 uses individual coil-on-plug ignition coils for each cylinder. They fail with age and heat exposure.

## Symptoms
- Misfire (rough running, flashing check engine light)
- Fault codes: P0301-P0306 (individual cylinder misfire)
- Reduced power
- Rough idle
- Poor fuel economy

## Diagnosis
- Read fault codes to identify affected cylinder(s)
- Swap suspected coil to different cylinder
- If misfire follows the coil, it's confirmed faulty
- Check spark plug condition when removing coils

## Replacement
See DIY: Spark Plug Replacement guide — coils are removed in the same process.

## Recommendations
- Replace all 6 coils at the same time (they're the same age)
- Bosch or Delphi recommended
- Replace spark plugs when replacing coils
- Inspect coil boots for cracks or carbon tracking
