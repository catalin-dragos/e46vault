# Wheel Fitment Guide

Understanding wheel fitment ensures proper clearance, handling, and appearance.

## Safe Fitment Ranges

### Square Setup (same front/rear)
- 17x8 ET35-47 with 225/45R17
- 18x8 ET35-45 with 225/40R18
- 18x8.5 ET35-42 with 235/40R18

### Staggered Setup
- Front: 18x8 ET35-45 with 225/40R18
- Rear: 18x9 ET35-42 with 255/35R18

## Offset Guidelines

- Stock offset: ET47
- Lower offset = wheel sits further out
- Going below ET30 will likely require fender work
- Each 1mm of offset change = 1mm of outward movement

## Spacer Information

- Hub-centric spacers recommended (72.56mm bore)
- Common sizes: 5mm, 10mm, 12mm, 15mm, 20mm
- 15mm+ requires extended lug bolts
- Torque wheel bolts to 120 Nm with spacers
