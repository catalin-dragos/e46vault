# TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring)

The E46 uses an indirect TPMS system that relies on wheel speed sensors rather than pressure sensors in the wheels.

## How It Works

The system compares rotational speeds of all four wheels through the ABS sensors. An underinflated tire has a smaller rolling diameter and rotates faster, triggering a warning.

## Resetting TPMS

After adjusting tire pressures or rotating tires:
1. Set all tires to recommended pressure
2. Press and hold the TPMS reset button (in center console or iDrive)
3. Drive for several miles to complete relearn

## Recommended Pressures

| Condition | Front | Rear |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Normal driving | 32 PSI (2.2 bar) | 36 PSI (2.5 bar) |
| Full load | 35 PSI (2.4 bar) | 41 PSI (2.8 bar) |
| Track use | 36-38 PSI cold | 38-42 PSI cold |
