# Lug Bolts

The E46 uses lug bolts (not lug nuts) to secure wheels to the hub.

## Specifications

- Thread: M12 x 1.5
- Seat type: 60° conical (cone seat)
- Stock length: 45mm (may vary by wheel)
- Torque: 120 Nm (88 ft-lb)
- Quantity: 5 per wheel (20 total)

## Aftermarket Considerations

- **Extended bolts**: Required with spacers 15mm+
- **Ball seat vs cone seat**: Must match wheel design
- **Wheel locks**: Use one locking bolt per wheel with key
- **Material**: Grade 10.9 or higher steel recommended

## Torque Procedure

1. Hand-thread all 5 bolts to prevent cross-threading
2. Torque in star pattern
3. Final torque: 120 Nm
4. Re-torque after first 100 km with new wheels
