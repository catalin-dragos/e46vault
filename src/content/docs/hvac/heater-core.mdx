# Heater Core

The heater core is a small radiator inside the HVAC box that uses engine coolant to heat the cabin air.

## Symptoms of Failure
- Sweet coolant smell in cabin
- Foggy windshield (coolant vapor)
- Wet passenger footwell
- Coolant level dropping without visible external leak
- Poor heater performance

## Replacement
This is one of the most labor-intensive repairs on the E46:
1. Drain coolant
2. Remove entire dashboard assembly
3. Remove HVAC box
4. Split HVAC box to access heater core
5. Replace heater core and reassemble

## Considerations
- Budget a full day or more for this job
- Consider professional repair ($800-$1,200 at independent shop)
- Replace blend door actuators while HVAC is apart
- Flush heater core hoses during coolant system overhaul
