# Blend Doors

Blend doors control the mixing of hot and cold air and the direction of airflow inside the HVAC system.

## Common Issues
- Clicking noise from behind dashboard (actuator gears stripping)
- One side blows hot, other blows cold
- Air only comes from one set of vents
- Temperature doesn't change despite adjustment

## Actuators
Multiple actuators control different blend doors:
- Temperature blend (hot/cold mixing)
- Mode blend (face/feet/windshield distribution)
- Fresh air/recirculation door

## Repair
Actuator replacement requires partial dashboard disassembly. If doing a heater core, replace all blend door actuators at the same time.
