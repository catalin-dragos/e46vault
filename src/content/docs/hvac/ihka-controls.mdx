# IHKA Climate Controls

The IHKA system automatically controls cabin temperature, fan speed, and air distribution.

## Control Panel Functions
- Temperature setting (driver and passenger on dual-zone models)
- Fan speed override
- A/C compressor on/off
- Recirculation mode
- Rear defroster
- Max defrost mode
- Air distribution (face, feet, windshield)

## Automatic Mode
In AUTO mode, the system adjusts fan speed, blend door position, and air distribution to reach the set temperature. Manual overrides are possible for any function.

## Common Issues
- LCD pixel fade on control panel display
- Button illumination bulb failure
- Temperature sensor failure (incorrect cabin temp reading)
- Sun sensor failure (dashboard-mounted, affects auto mode)
