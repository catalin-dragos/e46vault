# A/C Recharge

## Before Recharging
- A/C systems do NOT consume refrigerant — if it's low, there's a leak
- Find and fix the leak before recharging
- Common leak points: compressor shaft seal, O-rings at connections, condenser

## DIY Recharge (Top-Off)
1. Connect manifold gauge set to high and low side ports
2. Start engine, turn A/C to max cold, max fan
3. Check pressures against specifications
4. Add R134a refrigerant as needed
5. Do NOT overcharge — damages the compressor

## Pressure Specifications
- Low side: 25-45 PSI (running, A/C on)
- High side: 150-250 PSI (varies with ambient temperature)

## Professional Service Recommended
A proper A/C service includes:
- Recover existing refrigerant
- Vacuum test for leaks
- Evacuate system (30+ minutes vacuum)
- Recharge with exact amount by weight
- Add correct amount of PAG oil
- UV dye for future leak detection
