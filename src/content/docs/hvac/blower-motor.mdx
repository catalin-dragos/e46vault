## Location
Under the passenger-side dashboard, inside the HVAC housing.

## Symptoms of Failure
- No air flow at any speed
- Reduced air flow
- Unusual noise (grinding, squealing)
- Intermittent operation

## Replacement
Part: 64 11 8 372 493 (Behr OEM recommended)
1. Remove glove box or lower dash panel
2. Disconnect blower motor electrical connector
3. Remove blower motor retaining clips/screws

## Note
