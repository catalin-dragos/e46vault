# Evaporator

The evaporator is located inside the HVAC box and cools the air flowing into the cabin.

## Symptoms of Failure
- Reduced cooling performance
- Musty smell (bacterial growth on wet evaporator)
- Refrigerant leak inside the cabin
- Wet passenger footwell (evaporator drain clogged or leaking)

## Evaporator Drain
A clogged evaporator drain is a common cause of water in the passenger footwell. The drain tube exits under the car on the passenger side — clear with compressed air if clogged.

## Replacement
Similar to heater core, requires dashboard and HVAC box removal. If doing heater core, inspect and potentially replace the evaporator at the same time.

## Odor Prevention
Run the blower on high with A/C off for the last few minutes of a drive. This dries the evaporator surface and prevents mold/mildew growth.
