# Suspension Upgrades

This guide covers the most popular and effective suspension upgrades for the E46 330 platform, from mild street improvements to full track preparation.

## Sway Bars

Upgrading sway bars is one of the most cost-effective handling improvements:
- Stock front: 24.5mm solid
- Stock rear: 18mm solid
- **Recommended upgrade**: H&R or Whiteline adjustable set

## Bushings

Replacing worn rubber bushings with polyurethane or solid alternatives improves response:
- **Control arm bushings (FCAB)**: Powerflex or Turner Motorsport
- **Rear trailing arm bushings (RTAB)**: Powerflex or BimmerWorld Delrin
- **Rear subframe bushings**: Powerflex or solid aluminum
- **Rear shock mounts (RSM)**: Solid replacements eliminate deflection

## Strut Braces

- Front strut tower brace: Improves turn-in response
- Rear shock tower brace: Reduces flex in coupe/convertible

## Lowering Springs (without coilovers)

- **H&R Sport**: ~1.3" drop, good street comfort
- **Eibach Pro-Kit**: ~1.0" drop, mild and compliant
- **H&R Race**: ~1.75" drop, firmer, may need bump stops
