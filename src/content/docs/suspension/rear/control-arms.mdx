# Rear Control Arms

The E46 rear multi-link suspension uses five separate links per side. Understanding each link's function is key to diagnosing handling issues.

## Rear Suspension Links

1. **Trailing arm (central arm)**: Main structural link, carries spring/shock
2. **Upper control arm**: Controls camber
3. **Lower control arm**: Controls camber and lateral location
4. **Toe link (integral link)**: Controls rear toe
5. **Camber link**: Fine camber control
