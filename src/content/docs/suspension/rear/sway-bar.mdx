# Rear Sway Bar

The rear sway bar helps control body roll and improves handling balance.

## Specifications

- Stock diameter: 18mm solid
- Connected via end links to trailing arms

## Upgrade Options

Upgrading the rear sway bar changes the handling balance:
- **Stiffer rear bar**: Reduces understeer, promotes rotation
- **H&R rear sway bar**: 21mm or 23mm options
- **Whiteline adjustable**: Multiple stiffness settings
- **No rear bar**: Maximum rear grip (rain/snow driving)

## End Link Replacement

Same procedure as front:
- Torque end link nuts: 34 Nm
- Replace if clunking or worn
