# Front Wheel Bearings

The E46 uses hub-type front wheel bearings that are pressed into the steering knuckle. Replacement requires a press or special tools.

## Symptoms of Failed Wheel Bearings

- Humming or growling noise that changes with speed
- Noise changes when turning (loading/unloading bearing)
- Play felt when rocking wheel at 12/6 o'clock
- ABS warning light (in severe cases)

## Diagnosis

1. Raise vehicle and spin wheel — listen for roughness
2. Grab wheel at 12 and 6 o'clock, rock back and forth
3. Any play indicates a worn bearing
4. Drive in circles both directions — noise changes indicate which side

## Replacement Options

- Press-in bearing replacement (requires hydraulic press)
- Complete hub/bearing assembly (bolt-on, easier)
- Hub nut torque: 290 Nm (replace nut after removal)
