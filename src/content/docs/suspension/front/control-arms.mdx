# Front Control Arms

The E46 uses aluminum lower control arms that are a known wear item. The bushings and ball joints are integrated and non-serviceable — the entire arm must be replaced when worn.

## Symptoms of Worn Control Arms

- Steering wheel vibration at highway speeds
- Clunking over bumps (especially ball joint)
- Wandering or vague steering feel
- Uneven tire wear (inner edge)
- Failed alignment (cannot achieve specs)

## OEM and Aftermarket Options

- **Lemförder**: OEM supplier — recommended for stock replacement
- **Meyle HD**: Heavy-duty aftermarket with improved bushings
- **TRW**: Quality OEM alternative
- **Powerflex**: Replacement bushings only (pressed-in)

## Key Part Numbers

- Left control arm: 31 12 6 783 376
- Right control arm: 31 12 6 783 377
- Ball joint nut: Self-locking, replace each time

## Replacement Tips

- Always replace in pairs (left and right)
- Torque control arm-to-subframe bolt to 90 Nm at ride height
- Ball joint to steering knuckle nut: 65 Nm with new self-locking nut
- Alignment mandatory after replacement
