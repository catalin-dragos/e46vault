Reinforcing the rear subframe mounting points is a common preventive measure and repair for the E46. This is considered essential for track cars and recommended for all E46s.

## Reinforcement Plate Options

- **BimmerWorld plates**: Bolt-on reinforcement

- **Turner Motorsport**: Bolt-on reinforcement kit
- **DIY steel plates**: Custom fabricated, welded

## Procedure Overview

### Bolt-On Reinforcement
1. Remove rear subframe (or partially lower)
2. Clean mounting point areas
3. Apply reinforcement plates with supplied hardware
4. Re-install subframe with new bushings
5. Torque to specification
6. Full rear alignment required

### Weld-In Reinforcement
1. Remove rear subframe completely
2. Clean and prep floor pan
3. Weld reinforcement plates to floor pan
4. Seam seal and paint
5. New subframe bushings recommended
6. Re-install subframe, torque to spec
7. Full alignment required
