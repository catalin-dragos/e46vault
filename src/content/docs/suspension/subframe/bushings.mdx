# Rear Subframe Bushings

The rear subframe bushings isolate the subframe from the unibody, absorbing vibration and noise. They can wear over time, contributing to handling issues.

## Bushing Types

- **OEM rubber**: Factory comfort and NVH isolation
- **Powerflex polyurethane**: Longer lasting, moderate NVH increase
- **Solid aluminum**: Zero deflection, significant NVH, track only
- **Delrin**: Solid with some NVH isolation, popular track choice

## Replacement Considerations

- Subframe must be lowered or removed for bushing replacement
- Excellent time to inspect and reinforce mounting points
- New hardware recommended
- Rear M14 subframe bolts (diff to subframe): 174 Nm
- Subframe to body bolts (M12): 77 Nm
- Full alignment mandatory after reinstallation
