# Rear Subframe

The E46 rear subframe is a critical structural component that supports the entire rear suspension, differential, and driveshaft. It is the subject of a well-known structural issue.

## Subframe Mounting Points

The rear subframe is attached to the unibody at four points:
- Two front mounts (forward edge of subframe)
- Two rear mounts (aft edge of subframe)

These mounting points can crack and separate from the body, especially on higher-mileage cars or those driven hard.

## Inspection

Regular inspection is recommended, especially when purchasing a used E46:
1. Remove rear seat bottom
2. Inspect floor pan around mounting points
3. Look for cracking paint, rust, or separation
4. Check from underneath for torn bushings or movement

## Warning Signs

- Clunking from rear under acceleration or braking
- Visible cracks in floor pan near mount points
- Uneven rear tire wear
- Misaligned rear subframe
