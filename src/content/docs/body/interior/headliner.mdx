# Headliner

## Common Issue: Headliner Sagging
The fabric headliner can sag due to adhesive failure from heat and age.

## Repair Options
1. **Headliner adhesive spray**: Re-glue sagging sections (temporary fix)
2. **Full headliner replacement**: Remove headliner board, strip old fabric, apply new fabric with proper adhesive
3. **Professional re-trim**: $300-$600 at an auto upholstery shop

## Headliner Removal
Requires removing: sun visors, dome lights, A/B/C pillar trim, and rear shelf. The headliner board slides out through one of the doors (sedan) or through the top (coupe with top down).
