# Dashboard

The E46 dashboard uses a two-tone design with an integrated center console angled toward the driver.

## Common Issues
- Dashboard cracking (heat/UV exposure, particularly in hot climates)
- Pixel fade on instrument cluster (see Common Problems)
- Air vent tab breakage
- Glovebox hinge/latch failure

## Removal
The dashboard can be removed for heater core replacement or major electrical work. This is a complex procedure requiring removal of steering column, center console, and all dash components.
