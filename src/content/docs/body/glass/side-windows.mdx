# Side Windows

## Features
- Frameless windows (coupe and convertible)
- Framed windows (sedan)
- Auto-up/down on all windows (with one-touch feature)

## Frameless Window Alignment (Coupe)
Frameless windows on the coupe/convertible drop slightly when the door is opened and rise when closed for seal clearance. If alignment is off, adjust via the window regulator or door alignment.
