# Windshield

## Types
- Standard clear windshield
- Green-tinted windshield (option S354A)
- Rain sensor equipped (option S521A — sensor pad on windshield)

## Replacement Considerations
- Use OEM or quality aftermarket (Pilkington, Saint-Gobain)
- Rain sensor models need correct windshield with sensor pad
- Recalibrate rain sensor after replacement
- Ensure proper urethane bonding for structural integrity
