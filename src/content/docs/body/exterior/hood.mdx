# Hood

The E46 hood is steel and hinged at the firewall. It uses a cable-release mechanism.

## Hood Cable
- Common issue: Cable fraying or breaking
- If cable breaks, access release mechanism through grille or from underneath
- Replacement requires routing new cable through firewall

## Hood Alignment
- Adjust via hinge bolts and rubber bump stops
- Hood should sit flush with fenders
- Adjust height with bump stops at front corners

## Hood Struts
- Gas struts support the hood when open
- Replace when hood doesn't stay up
- Inexpensive and easy to replace
