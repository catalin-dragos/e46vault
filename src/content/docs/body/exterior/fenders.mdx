# Fenders

The E46 fenders are bolt-on steel panels that can be replaced without welding.

## Removal
1. Remove front bumper
2. Remove fender liner
3. Remove fender-to-door bolt
4. Remove fender-to-chassis bolts (under hood)
5. Disconnect side marker light
6. Remove fender

## Common Issues
- Rust at lower edges (salt belt cars)
- Stone chip damage on leading edge
- Fender liner damage from debris

## Fender Rolling
For wider wheel fitments, the inner fender lip can be rolled using a fender rolling tool. This provides additional clearance without cutting.
