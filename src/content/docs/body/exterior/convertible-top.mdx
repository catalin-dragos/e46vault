# Convertible Top (330Ci)

The E46 convertible uses a hydraulic-operated soft top. Proper care extends its life significantly.

## Maintenance
- Clean fabric with dedicated convertible top cleaner
- Apply fabric protector/waterproofer annually
- Lubricate latches and hinges periodically
- Keep rear window clean (plastic rear window models)
- Do not operate in freezing temperatures

## Common Issues
See Common Problems section for detailed convertible top hydraulic issues.

## Rear Window Care
- Do NOT fold top down with cold rear window (cracking risk)
- Clean plastic window with plastic polish, not glass cleaner
- Store with top UP when possible to prevent window creasing
