# Trunk Lock

## Release Methods
- Key fob remote button
- Interior release button (center console, near driver's left knee)
- Key cylinder on trunk lid

## Common Issues
- Lock actuator failure (won't unlock with remote or button)
- Key cylinder wear
- Release cable stretching or breaking

## Emergency Access
If electrical release fails, use the physical key in the trunk lock cylinder. If that also fails, access through the rear seat fold-down (sedan) or ski pass-through.
