# Door Locks

The E46 uses a central locking system controlled by the General Module (GM). All doors lock/unlock simultaneously via key, key fob, or interior buttons.

## Components
- Door lock actuators (one per door)
- Central locking button (center console)
- Key fob (remote locking)
- Key cylinder (driver's door)
- General Module (GM) controller

## Common Issues
See Common Problems section for door lock actuator failure diagnosis and repair.

## Double-Lock Feature
Double-pressing the lock button on the key fob activates double-lock mode, which prevents the doors from being opened from inside. Useful for security but be aware for emergency exit purposes.
