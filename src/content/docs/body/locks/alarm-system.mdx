# Alarm System

## Factory System
- EWS (Electronic Wegfahrsperre) immobilizer — engine won't start without correct key
- Interior motion sensor (tilt sensor)
- Door, hood, and trunk contact switches
- Horn alarm activation

## Common Issues
- False alarms from interior motion sensor (tilt sensor)
- Alarm triggering from low battery
- EWS synchronization loss (key not recognized)

## EWS Reset
If the car won't start (EWS key not recognized):
1. Lock car with key, wait 30 seconds
2. Unlock with key
3. Insert key and try to start
4. If still no start, EWS module may need re-alignment with DME (requires BMW diagnostic tool)

## Tilt Sensor Disable
To prevent false alarms, press the tilt sensor button (located on the headliner near the dome light or on the center console) before locking the car.
