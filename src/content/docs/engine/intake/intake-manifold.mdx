# Intake Manifold

The M54 intake manifold is a composite design with a DISA valve for variable-length intake runners. The manifold provides optimized airflow across the RPM range.

## Key Features
- Variable-length runners via DISA valve
- Individual throttle-adjacent runners for each cylinder
- Composite construction (plastic upper, aluminum lower)

## Common Issues
- DISA valve flap failure (see DISA Valve page)
- Manifold gasket leaks (vacuum leaks)
- CCV hose connections deteriorating
- Swirl flap concerns (more common on N-series engines)

## Removal Required For
- CCV valve replacement
- Injector replacement
- DISA valve service
- Some VANOS work
