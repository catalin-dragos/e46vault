# Throttle Body

The M54 uses an electronic throttle body (drive-by-wire) controlled by the DME.

## Operation
- Accelerator pedal sensor sends signal to DME
- DME commands throttle plate position via electric motor
- No throttle cable

## Common Issues
- Carbon buildup on throttle plate (clean periodically)
- Throttle position sensor failure (rare)
- Adaptation values drift (reset with INPA/ISTA)

## Cleaning
1. Remove intake boot from throttle body
2. Spray throttle cleaner on plate and bore
3. Wipe clean with rag
4. Avoid spraying directly into throttle body interior
5. Reset throttle adaptation after cleaning
