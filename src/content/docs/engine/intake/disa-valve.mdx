# DISA Valve

The DISA (Differentiated Intake System Actuator) valve controls a flap in the intake manifold that changes the effective runner length for optimized torque across the RPM range.

## How It Works
- Below ~3,500 RPM: Flap closed, long runners for low-end torque
- Above ~3,500 RPM: Flap open, short runners for high-RPM power

## Critical Failure Warning
The flap is held by a metal pin. If this pin breaks, the metal flap can be ingested into the engine, causing catastrophic damage. Part: 11 61 7 544 805.

## Inspection
Remove DISA from manifold and check:
- Flap pin for wear or looseness
- Flap movement (should be free but not wobbly)
- Diaphragm condition
- O-ring seal condition

See Common Problems section for more details.
