# Idle Control

The M54 controls idle speed through the electronic throttle body. Unlike older BMWs, there is no separate idle control valve (ICV).

## Idle Specifications
- Target idle: ~600-700 RPM (warm, in neutral/park)
- Slightly higher when cold or with A/C on
- DME adjusts throttle opening to maintain target

## Rough Idle Causes
- Vacuum leaks (most common)
- Dirty throttle body
- Failed VANOS seals
- CCV valve failure
- Bad ignition coil or spark plug
- Low fuel pressure
- Dirty MAF sensor

## Idle Relearn Procedure
After battery disconnect or throttle body cleaning:
1. Turn key to position 2 (ignition on, engine off) for 30 seconds
2. Start engine, let idle for 3 minutes
3. Turn A/C on for 1 minute
4. Turn A/C off, let idle for 1 minute
5. Drive normally — adaptation continues automatically
