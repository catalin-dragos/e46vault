# MAF Sensor (Mass Airflow)

The MAF sensor measures incoming air volume and is critical for proper fuel mixture calculations.

## Symptoms of Failure
- Rough idle, hesitation
- Poor fuel economy
- Check engine light
- Lean fault codes (P0171, P0174)

## Diagnosis
- Monitor MAF readings with scan tool
- At idle: ~15-20 g/s
- At WOT: ~170-200 g/s
- Erratic or flat readings indicate failure

## Cleaning
- Use MAF sensor cleaner spray only
- Do NOT touch the sensing element
- Clean every 30,000 miles as preventive maintenance

## Note on Oiled Air Filters
K&N and other oiled filters can contaminate the MAF sensor. If using an oiled filter, clean the MAF sensor more frequently.
