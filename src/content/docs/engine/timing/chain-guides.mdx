# Timing Chain & Guides

The M54 uses a single-row timing chain that drives both camshafts. Unlike timing belts, the chain is designed to last the life of the engine.

## Components
- Single-row timing chain
- Upper chain guide (plastic)
- Lower chain guide (plastic)
- Chain tensioner (hydraulic)
- Sprockets (crankshaft, camshafts)

## Common Issues
- Chain stretch: Very rare on M54 (more common on N-series)
- Guide wear: Plastic guides can wear over 150k+ miles
- Rattle on startup: Usually VANOS, not chain (check VANOS first)

## Inspection
- Timing chain noise is a low-pitched rattle from front of engine
- Check chain stretch with timing marks at TDC
- Chain replacement is a major job — typically not needed on M54 under 200k miles
