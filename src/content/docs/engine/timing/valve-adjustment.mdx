# Valve Adjustment

The M54 uses hydraulic valve lifters (hydraulic lash adjusters) that automatically maintain correct valve clearance. No manual valve adjustment is required.

## Hydraulic Lifters
- Self-adjusting using engine oil pressure
- No service interval for adjustment
- Ticking noise can indicate low oil pressure or worn lifter

## Lifter Noise
If you hear valve train ticking:
1. Check oil level and condition first
2. A brief tick on cold start is normal (lifters filling with oil)
3. Persistent ticking may indicate a worn lifter
4. Ensure oil pressure is correct
5. Use correct oil viscosity (5W-30)
