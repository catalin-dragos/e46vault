# Chain Tensioner

The hydraulic chain tensioner maintains proper timing chain tension using engine oil pressure.

## Function
- Spring-loaded plunger backed by oil pressure
- Automatically adjusts for chain wear
- Ratcheting mechanism prevents retraction

## Failure Signs
- Chain rattle on cold start (before oil pressure builds)
- Persistent timing chain noise
- Note: Cold start rattle is more commonly VANOS than chain tensioner on M54

## Replacement
- Located on front of engine block
- Accessible without major disassembly
- Replace if confirmed failed (rare on M54)
