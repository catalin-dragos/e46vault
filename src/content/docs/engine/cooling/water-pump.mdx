# Water Pump

The M54 water pump is mechanical (belt-driven) with a plastic impeller. The plastic impeller is the weak point — it can crack or shed blades, causing loss of coolant circulation and overheating.

## Symptoms of Failure
- Coolant leak from weep hole
- Overheating at idle or highway speeds
- Squealing or grinding noise
- Temperature fluctuation

## Replacement
Part: 11 53 1 437 040. Recommended upgrade: Stewart water pump (metal impeller).

## Installation Notes
- Replace with cooling system overhaul
- Water pump bolts: 10 Nm (M6 into aluminum)
- Always replace O-ring seal
- Bleed cooling system after installation
