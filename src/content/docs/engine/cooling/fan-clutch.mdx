# Fan Clutch

The mechanical fan is driven by the engine via a viscous coupling (fan clutch) that varies fan speed based on temperature.

## Part Number
17 11 1 440 252

## Signs of Failure
- Overheating at idle or in traffic
- Fan spins freely when cold (should have some resistance)
- Fan roars loudly at all times (seized clutch)
- Coolant loss from fan striking hoses

## Removal Note
The fan clutch uses a LEFT-HAND THREAD (32mm nut). Turn CLOCKWISE to loosen. Requires a 32mm thin wrench and fan holder tool.

## Replacement
Replace with every cooling system overhaul. Install with fan blade — torque fan clutch nut to 40 Nm.
