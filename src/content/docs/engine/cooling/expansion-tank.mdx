# Expansion Tank

The plastic expansion tank is one of the most common failure points. It develops hairline cracks that can lead to sudden coolant loss.

## Part Number
17 13 7 543 003

## Signs of Failure
- White residue on or around tank
- Coolant smell
- Low coolant warning
- Visible hairline cracks
- Sudden overheating

## Replacement Interval
Every 60,000 miles or with cooling system overhaul. Replace proactively — the cost of the tank ($30-$50) is nothing compared to engine damage from overheating.
