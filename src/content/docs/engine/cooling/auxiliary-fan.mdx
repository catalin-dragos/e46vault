# Auxiliary Electric Fan

The auxiliary electric fan (behind the radiator) provides additional cooling at low speeds, in traffic, and when the A/C is running.

## Operation
- Activated by DME based on coolant temperature
- Also activated when A/C compressor engages
- Runs after engine shutdown if coolant is hot

## Common Issues
- Motor failure (stops spinning)
- Resistor failure (only runs at one speed)
- Wiring connector corrosion

## Diagnosis
- Check if fan spins when A/C is turned on
- Listen for fan running after hot shutdown
- Check fuse F2 (30A) or F3 (40A) in engine bay fuse box
