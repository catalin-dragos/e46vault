# Cooling System Overview

The M54 cooling system is the most critical maintenance area on the E46. All major components are plastic and have a finite lifespan.

## System Components
- Water pump (mechanical, belt-driven)
- Thermostat (97°C opening temperature)
- Radiator (aluminum core, plastic end tanks)
- Expansion tank (pressurized, plastic)
- Fan clutch (viscous coupling)
- Auxiliary electric fan
- Upper and lower radiator hoses
- Heater core and hoses
- Coolant temperature sensor

## Total System Capacity
- 8.4 liters (8.9 US quarts)
- Mix: 50/50 BMW Blue coolant and distilled water

## Maintenance Schedule
Replace the entire cooling system every 60,000-80,000 miles. This is the single most important preventive maintenance on the E46.
