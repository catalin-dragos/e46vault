# Drive Belts

The M54 uses a single serpentine belt driving the alternator, power steering pump, A/C compressor, and water pump.

## Specifications
- Belt: 6PK1538 (11 28 7 838 200)
- Replace every 50,000 miles or if cracked/glazed
- See DIY section for replacement procedure

## Tensioner and Idler Pulley
Replace every 80,000 miles or with belt if noisy. A failing tensioner causes belt squeal and can lead to belt failure.
