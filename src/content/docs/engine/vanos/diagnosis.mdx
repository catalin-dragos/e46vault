# VANOS Diagnosis

## Symptoms of VANOS Problems
- Rough idle, especially when cold
- Loss of low-end torque (below 3,000 RPM)
- Hesitation during acceleration
- Cold start rattle (1-2 seconds)
- Reduced fuel economy
- Check engine light with VANOS codes

## Fault Codes
- P0010: Intake cam position actuator circuit
- P0011: Intake cam timing over-advanced
- P0012: Intake cam timing over-retarded
- P0015: Exhaust cam timing over-retarded
- P1519: Intake camshaft control malfunction

## Diagnostic Steps
1. **Read codes** — VANOS-specific codes point to the system
2. **Cold start test** — Listen for rattle on first start of the day
3. **INPA/ISTA adaptation values** — Check VANOS deviation
4. **Oil condition** — Dirty or low oil worsens VANOS symptoms
5. **Solenoid test** — Measure resistance (should be ~7-8 ohms)
6. **Visual inspection** — Check solenoid wiring and connectors

## Common Causes (in order of likelihood)
1. Worn VANOS seals (most common)
2. Failed VANOS solenoid
3. Low oil level or degraded oil
4. Clogged oil passages
5. Worn VANOS unit internals
