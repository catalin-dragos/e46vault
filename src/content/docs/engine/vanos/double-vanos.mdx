# Double VANOS System

The M54 uses a "double" VANOS system, meaning both intake AND exhaust camshafts are continuously variable. Earlier BMW engines used single VANOS (intake only).

## Intake VANOS
- Adjustment range: ~60 degrees crankshaft
- Advances intake valve opening for better low-end torque
- Retards intake timing at high RPM for better breathing

## Exhaust VANOS
- Adjustment range: ~40 degrees crankshaft
- Optimizes valve overlap for emissions and performance
- Reduces pumping losses at part throttle

## VANOS Unit Construction
The VANOS unit bolts to the front of the cylinder head and contains:
- Helical spline gears for both cams
- Oil passages and seals
- Solenoid mounting points
- Internal oil pump

## Common Issues
The Teflon piston seals within the VANOS unit are the primary failure point. See the Diagnosis and Rebuild pages for details.
