# How VANOS Works

VANOS (Variable Nockenwellensteuerung) is BMW's variable valve timing system. The M54 uses dual VANOS, adjusting both intake and exhaust camshaft timing.

## Operating Principle

The VANOS system uses oil pressure to rotate the camshafts relative to their drive gears:
1. DME calculates optimal cam timing based on RPM, load, temperature
2. DME signals the VANOS solenoids (one intake, one exhaust)
3. Solenoids direct oil pressure to the VANOS actuator
4. Actuator rotates the camshaft relative to the sprocket
5. Continuously variable — not just on/off positions

## Benefits
- Improved low-end torque
- Better high-RPM power
- Reduced emissions
- Smoother idle
- Better fuel economy

## VANOS Components
- **VANOS unit**: Mounted on front of cylinder head
- **Intake solenoid**: Controls intake cam timing
- **Exhaust solenoid**: Controls exhaust cam timing
- **Teflon seals**: Seal oil passages within the unit
- **Oil pump (internal)**: Supplies high-pressure oil to VANOS
