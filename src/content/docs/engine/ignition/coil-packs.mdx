# Ignition Coils

The M54 uses 6 individual coil-on-plug ignition coils. They are a common failure point as the car ages.

## Symptoms
- Misfires (P0301-P0306)
- Rough idle
- Check engine light (flashing = active misfire)
- Reduced power

## Diagnosis
Swap suspected coil to a different cylinder. If the misfire follows the coil, replace it.

## Replacement
Replace all 6 at the same time — they're the same age. Bosch or Delphi recommended. See DIY: Spark Plug Replacement for procedure (coils are removed in the same process).
