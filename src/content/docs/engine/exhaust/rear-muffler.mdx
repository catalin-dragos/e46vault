# Rear Muffler

The rear muffler is the final component of the exhaust system and determines the exhaust sound character.

## OEM
- Single outlet on standard 330i
- Dual outlet on some packages and ZHP
- Stainless steel or aluminized steel construction

## Replacement Options
- OEM replacement for quiet stock sound
- Aftermarket: Supersprint, Borla, Magnaflow for more sound
- Custom: 2.5" mandrel-bent for best flow

## Exhaust Hanger Replacement
Rubber exhaust hangers deteriorate and should be replaced if sagging. They're inexpensive and easy to swap.
