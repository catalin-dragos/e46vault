# Fuel Injectors

The M54 uses 6 port-fuel injectors (one per cylinder) rated at 258cc/min flow rate.

## Symptoms of Faulty Injectors
- Misfires on specific cylinders
- Rough idle
- Poor fuel economy
- Fuel smell from engine bay
- Uneven exhaust gas readings

## Maintenance
- Injectors rarely fail on the M54
- Cleaning with injector cleaner fuel additive is beneficial
- Professional ultrasonic cleaning available for stuck injectors
- Replace O-rings if removing injectors

## Upgrade for Forced Induction
Stock injectors max out around 250 hp. For forced induction, upgrade to 440cc+ injectors.
