# Fuel Pressure Regulator

The fuel pressure regulator maintains constant fuel rail pressure at approximately 3.5 bar (50 PSI). It's vacuum-referenced to maintain consistent pressure differential across the injectors.

## Symptoms of Failure
- Hard starting
- Rich running (black smoke, fuel smell)
- Fuel in vacuum line (pull vacuum line and check for fuel)
- Inconsistent fuel pressure readings

## Diagnosis
- Connect fuel pressure gauge to test port on fuel rail
- Key on, engine off: ~3.5 bar
- Engine running: ~3.0 bar (vacuum-referenced drop)
- Pressure should hold after engine off (no rapid drop)
