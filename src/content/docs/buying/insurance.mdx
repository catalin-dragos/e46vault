# Insurance & Registration

## Insurance Considerations

- E46 330s are relatively affordable to insure due to age and value
- Full coverage may not be cost-effective on lower-value examples
- Agreed-value or classic car policies available for well-maintained examples
- Track day coverage typically requires separate policy or rider
- Modifications can affect insurance — disclose major changes

## Registration

- Standard registration in most states
- Emissions requirements vary by state:
  - California: SMOG check required, modifications can cause failure
  - Most states: OBD-II emissions test (no codes = pass)
  - Some states: No emissions testing
- Classic/antique plates available in some states for cars 25+ years old (2024+)

## Modifications and Insurance

- Intake/exhaust modifications generally don't affect insurance
- Forced induction (turbo/supercharger) should be disclosed
- Suspension modifications generally not a concern
- Major engine swaps may require engineering certification in some jurisdictions
