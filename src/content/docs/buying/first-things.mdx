# First Things After Purchase

Just bought an E46 330? Here's what to do first, in priority order.

## Immediate (First Week)

1. **Change engine oil and filter** — You don't know when it was last done
2. **Inspect cooling system** — Check expansion tank, hoses, coolant color
3. **Read fault codes** — Use any OBD-II scanner to check for stored codes
4. **Check all fluids** — Oil, coolant, brake fluid, power steering, transmission

## First Month

5. **Full cooling system refresh** if not recently done — This is the single most important preventive maintenance
6. **Inspect front control arms** — Check for play, vibration
7. **Replace cabin air filters** — Cheap, easy, often neglected
8. **Check tire condition and pressures** — Date codes, tread depth, even wear
9. **Inspect brake pads and rotors** — Measure pad thickness and rotor minimum
10. **Replace spark plugs** if unknown history

## First 3 Months

11. **Inspect rear subframe mounting points** — Pull rear seat, check for cracks
12. **Replace all bushings** if over 100k miles — Control arms, sway bar links
13. **Flush brake fluid** — If unknown age, flush immediately
14. **Transmission fluid change** — Despite "lifetime fill" claim
15. **Differential fluid change**
