# Alternative Models

If the E46 330 isn't the right fit, consider these alternatives in a similar price range and driving experience category.

## BMW Alternatives
- **E46 325i**: Less power but cheaper to buy and run; same platform
- **E46 M3**: More power, LSD, bigger brakes; significantly more expensive
- **E90 328i (N52)**: Newer, more refined, similar driving character
- **E36 M3**: Lighter, simpler, good track car; S52 engine

## Non-BMW Alternatives
- **Lexus IS300**: Bullet-proof reliability, less engaging to drive, 2JZ engine
- **Infiniti G35**: More power (VQ35), less refined chassis
- **Audi A4 1.8T (B5/B6)**: Turbo 4-cylinder, good mod platform, AWD available
- **Acura RSX Type-S / Integra Type-R**: FWD, lighter, rev-happy, different driving experience
- **Mazda Miata (NB/NC)**: Lighter, simpler, less power but incredible handling

## Why the E46 330 Wins

- Best inline-6 in its price range (M54 is legendary)
- RWD with excellent chassis balance
- Massive parts availability and community support
- Enough power for fun without being overwhelming
- Comfortable enough for daily driving
- Looks that have aged beautifully
