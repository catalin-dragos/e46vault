# Pre-Purchase Inspection

A thorough pre-purchase inspection can save you thousands. Either inspect yourself or pay for a professional PPI ($150-$300 at a BMW specialist).

## Engine Bay
- [ ] Check for oil leaks (valve cover, oil filter housing, oil pan)
- [ ] Inspect coolant level and condition (should be blue, not brown)
- [ ] Check expansion tank for cracks or white residue
- [ ] Squeeze coolant hoses — should be firm, not soft or swollen
- [ ] Inspect intake boot for cracks (pull apart to check underside)
- [ ] Listen for VANOS rattle on cold start
- [ ] Check for white smoke on startup (head gasket concern)

## Underneath
- [ ] Check for rust on subframe, floor pans, jack points
- [ ] Inspect rear subframe mounting points for cracks
- [ ] Check control arm bushings for play
- [ ] Inspect CV boots for tears
- [ ] Look for power steering rack leaks
- [ ] Check exhaust for rust-through

## Interior
- [ ] Test all power windows (regulator failure is common)
- [ ] Check instrument cluster for pixel fade
- [ ] Test HVAC on all settings (blower motor FSR)
- [ ] Check for airbag light (could be expensive fix)
- [ ] Test all locks with key fob

## Test Drive
- [ ] Cold start: VANOS rattle? Rough idle?
- [ ] Shifting: Smooth engagement? Grinding? (manual)
- [ ] Highway: Steering vibration? (control arms, wheel balance)
- [ ] Braking: Pulsation? Pulling? (warped rotors, caliper issue)
- [ ] Listen for suspension clunks over bumps
