# Buying Guide

The E46 330 is an excellent sports sedan/coupe that offers a great driving experience at an accessible price point. However, buying a 20+ year old BMW requires careful inspection and realistic expectations about maintenance costs.

## Key Considerations

1. **Maintenance history is everything** — A well-documented service history is more important than low mileage
2. **Cooling system status** — Has it been refreshed? If not, budget $500-$800 for immediate cooling system overhaul
3. **Subframe condition** — Check for rear subframe cracking (see Common Problems)
4. **Rust** — Major concern in salt-belt states
5. **Manual vs Automatic** — Manuals hold value better and are preferred by enthusiasts

## What to Expect

- Purchase price: $4,000-$15,000 depending on condition, mileage, and options
- Annual maintenance: $1,500-$3,000 for DIY, $3,000-$5,000 at independent shop
- These are **not** cheap to maintain — budget accordingly
