A short shift kit reduces the throw distance of the gear lever, resulting in quicker shifts. It is one of the most popular modifications for manual E46s.

## How It Works

Short shift kits relocate the pivot point of the shift lever, reducing the throw distance by 20-40% depending on the kit. This does increase the effort required to shift slightly.

## Popular Options

- **BMW ZHP short shift kit** — OEM option, moderate 20% reduction
- **UUC EVO3** — Popular aftermarket, adjustable reduction
- **DSSR (Diesel Short Shift Rod)** — Budget option using E46 320d shift rod

## Installation Notes

- Typically requires removing the center console
- Combine with shift linkage bushing upgrade for best results
- Most kits take 1-2 hours to install
