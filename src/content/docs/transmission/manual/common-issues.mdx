The Getrag S6S-420G is reliable, but some issues can develop at higher mileages.

## Common Issues

### Sloppy Shift Feel
- **Cause**: Worn shift linkage bushings
- **Fix**: Replace bushings with upgraded polyurethane/Delrin

### Hard Shifting When Cold
- **Cause**: Old or incorrect transmission fluid
- **Fix**: Change to fresh MTF-LT-2 or quality synthetic

### Grinding Into Gear
- **Cause**: Worn synchros (typically 2nd gear first)
- Fix: Fluid change may help or rebuild

### Input Shaft Bearing Noise
- Cause: Worn bearing at high mileage
- Symptoms: Whining that changes with clutch engagement
- Fix: Bearing replacement (transmission must be removed)

### Reverse Gear Crunch
- Cause: Normal for non-synchro reverse
- Tip: Briefly engage a forward gear, then select reverse
