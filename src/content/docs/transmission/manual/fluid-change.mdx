Regular fluid changes keep the manual transmission shifting smoothly and protect the synchros from premature wear.

## Fluid Specification

- **OEM**: BMW MTF-LT-2 (75W-80)
- **Alternatives**: Redline MTL, Royal Purple Synchromax
- **Capacity**: 1.5L

## Procedure Overview

1. Raise vehicle and support on jack stands
2. Locate fill plug and drain plug on the transmission (both 14mm Allen)
3. Remove fill plug FIRST (to ensure you can refill)
4. Remove drain plug and drain old fluid
5. Reinstall drain plug (50 Nm)
6. Pump new fluid through fill hole until it overflows
7. Reinstall fill plug (50 Nm)

## Tips

- Warm the transmission first by driving for 15 minutes (fluid flows better)
- The fill plug is higher than the drain plug on the driver side of the transmission
- If the old fluid is very dark or smells burnt, consider a second drain-and-fill
