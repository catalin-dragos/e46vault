The E46 uses a two-piece driveshaft with a center support bearing (CSB) mounted to the underside of the vehicle.

## Failure Symptoms

- Vibration at speed (especially 60-80 mph)
- Clunking noise from under the car on acceleration/deceleration
- Visible rubber deterioration when inspected

## Replacement Notes

- The driveshaft must be removed for CSB replacement
- Mark the driveshaft sections before removal for proper balance
- Typical replacement: when symptoms appear (usually 80,000+ miles)
- Replace the guibo at the same time
