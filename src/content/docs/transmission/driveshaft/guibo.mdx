The guibo (flex disc) is a rubber coupling between the transmission output flange and the front section of the driveshaft.

## Failure Symptoms

- Clunking noise on gear changes or throttle transitions
- Visible cracking or tearing of the rubber disc
- Vibration under load

## Inspection

Look for cracks in the rubber, separation between rubber and metal inserts, and elongated bolt holes.

## Replacement Notes

- Use new self-locking nuts (83 Nm torque)
- Replace every 80,000-100,000 miles
- Best replaced at the same time as the center support bearing
