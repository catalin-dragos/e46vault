The E46 driveshaft uses universal joints at the center joint between the front and rear driveshaft sections.

## Failure Symptoms

- Vibration at specific speeds
- Clicking or clunking noise from under the car
- Play felt when rotating the driveshaft by hand

## Maintenance

U-joints on the E46 are typically sealed and non-serviceable. If one fails, the driveshaft section or complete assembly is replaced.

## Tips

- Have the driveshaft professionally balanced if any components are replaced
- All 330 RWD models use a two-piece driveshaft
