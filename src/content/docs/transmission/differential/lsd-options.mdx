Adding an LSD is one of the most impactful performance modifications for the E46 330.

## OEM BMW LSD (from M3)

- Type 210 medium case LSD from the E46 M3
- Requires M3 output flanges and potentially different halfshafts
- Bolt-in if you source the complete M3 subframe/diff assembly

## Aftermarket LSD Units

- **OS Giken** - Superlock, plate-type clutch LSD
- **Quaife** - ATB helical gear LSD
- **Kaaz** - Plate-type clutch LSD
- **Wavetrac** - Helical gear LSD with wave profile

## Considerations

- Clutch-type LSDs require LSD-specific fluid and periodic service
- Helical/ATB LSDs are maintenance-free but less aggressive lockup
- Confirm correct ratio when sourcing any differential swap
