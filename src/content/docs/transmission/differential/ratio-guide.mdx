The differential ratio significantly affects acceleration, top speed, and fuel economy.

## Available Ratios (E46 Platform)

| Ratio | Source Model | Character |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 2.93:1 | E46 325i auto | Taller, more relaxed cruising |
| 3.07:1 | E46 330i manual | Balanced, OEM for manual 330 |
| 3.15:1 | E46 ZHP | Slightly shorter |

## Effect on Driving

- **Shorter (higher number)**: Quicker acceleration, higher RPM at cruise
- **Taller (lower number)**: Slower acceleration, lower RPM at cruise, better fuel economy

## Ratio Swap Considerations

- Match speedometer calibration when changing ratios (coding change needed)
- Shorter ratios pair well with manual transmission for spirited driving
- Ensure the differential type (168 vs 188 vs 210) matches your subframe
