The mechatronic unit (valve body/EGS) is the electro-hydraulic control unit inside the automatic transmission that manages gear selection and shift quality.

## Function

Contains solenoid valves and a control module that interprets driver input and vehicle conditions to determine optimal shift points.

## Common Issues

### Sleeve Connector Seal (ZF 5HP19)
The seal hardens with age, causing ATF to leak into the electrical connector. Symptoms:
- Erratic shifting
- Transmission fault codes
- Limp mode (stuck in one gear)

### Solenoid Wear
High-mileage transmissions may experience solenoid wear causing shift quality degradation.

## Repair

The sleeve connector seal can be replaced without removing the transmission — accessible by dropping the transmission pan.
