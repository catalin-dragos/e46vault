Regular ATF changes are critical for automatic transmission longevity. The fluid should be changed every 60,000 miles.

## Fluid Specifications

- **OEM**: Esso LT 71141
- **Alternatives**: Lifeguard 6, Pentosin ATF-1

## Procedure Overview

1. Warm the transmission by driving for 15-20 minutes
2. Raise vehicle on jack stands
3. Remove drain plug and drain fluid (~3L)
4. Remove and clean (or replace) the filter/strainer
5. Replace pan gasket if applicable
6. Reinstall drain plug
7. Fill through the fill tube using a pump
8. Check fluid level at operating temperature using the overflow procedure

## Fluid Level Check

Remove the fill plug at operating temperature. Fluid should trickle from the fill hole; if not, add fluid until it does.
