The dual-mass flywheel (DMF) dampens torsional vibrations between the engine and transmission.

## How It Works

Two flywheel masses connected by arc springs. The primary mass bolts to the crankshaft; the secondary mass faces the clutch disc.

## Failure Symptoms

- Rattling noise at idle (especially in neutral)
- Vibration when engaging clutch
- Excessive free play when rocking the flywheel by hand
- Difficulty shifting smoothly

## Single-Mass Flywheel Conversion

Some owners convert to a single-mass flywheel (SMF) to eliminate the DMF as a wear item.

- **Pros**: Lower cost, no future DMF failure, lighter weight
- **Cons**: More drivetrain vibration, harsher engagement, potential transmission wear
