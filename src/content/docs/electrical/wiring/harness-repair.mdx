Wiring harness issues are common on aging E46s, particularly in areas exposed to heat, moisture, or flexing.

## Common Problem Areas

- **Trunk lid harness**: Wires break from repeated opening/closing
- **Door harness**: Wire breakage in the rubber boot between door and body
- **Engine harness**: Heat damage to wiring near exhaust manifold
- **Driver's footwell**: Water intrusion from clogged drains damages LCM and wiring

## Repair Techniques

- Use solder and heat-shrink tubing for reliable wire splices
- Do not use twist-on wire nuts or electrical tape alone
- Match wire gauge and type when splicing
- Use split loom or wire conduit to protect repaired sections
- Apply dielectric grease to connectors in moisture-prone areas

## Trunk Wiring Harness

The trunk lid wiring harness is one of the most common E46 electrical repair items. Symptoms include intermittent tail lights, license plate lights, trunk release, and reverse camera (if equipped) failure.
