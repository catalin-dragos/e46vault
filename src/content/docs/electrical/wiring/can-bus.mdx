The Controller Area Network (CAN-bus) is the high-speed communication backbone connecting the E46 critical control modules.

## Specifications

- **Speed**: 500 kbit/s
- **Wiring**: Twisted pair (CAN-H and CAN-L)
- **Termination**: 120-ohm resistors at each end of the bus

## Connected Modules

- DME (engine management)
- EGS (automatic transmission, if equipped)
- ABS/DSC (braking and stability)
- IKE (instrument cluster)
- Steering angle sensor

## Diagnosis

CAN-bus issues can cause multiple seemingly unrelated faults. Common causes:
- Corroded CAN-bus connector pins
- Chafed wiring causing short circuits
- Failed module pulling down the bus
- Measure resistance between CAN-H and CAN-L: should be ~60 ohms with all modules connected
