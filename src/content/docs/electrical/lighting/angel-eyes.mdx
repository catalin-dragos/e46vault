The E46 (facelift models and M3) features angel eyes — the distinctive corona rings around the headlight projector and reflector lenses.

## OEM Angel Eyes

OEM angel eyes use small incandescent CCFL-style bulbs that produce a yellowish-white glow. They are prone to burnout over time.

## Upgrade Options

### LED Angel Eye Kits
- Replace the OEM bulbs with bright white LED modules
- Color temperatures from 5000K to 7000K available
- Most kits are plug-and-play
- Popular brands: Lux, BavAuto, Depo

### Pre-Facelift Angel Eye Retrofit
Pre-facelift headlights (1999-2002) did not come with angel eyes from the factory. Aftermarket headlight assemblies with integrated angel eyes are available, or angel eye rings can be retrofitted into existing headlights.

## Installation Notes

- Accessing the angel eye bulbs requires removing the headlight assembly on most models
- LED kits may require resistors to avoid flickering or error codes
