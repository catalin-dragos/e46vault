The E46 tail lights differ between sedan, coupe, and convertible body styles, and between pre-facelift and facelift models.

## Bulb Specifications

| Function | Bulb Type |
|----------|-----------|
| Tail/brake | P21/5W (dual filament) |
| Turn signal | PY21W (amber) |
| Reverse | P21W |
| Rear fog | P21W |

## Common Issues

- Burnt-out bulb warnings (check bulb and socket connections)
- Tail light gasket failure (moisture ingress)
- Connector melting from heat (especially on coupe models)
- Cracked lens from impact

## LED Conversions

LED tail light conversions are available but require resistors or a coding change to avoid bulb-out warnings from the LCM.
