## LED Upgrade

Replacing incandescent interior bulbs with LED equivalents is a popular and easy upgrade. Use high-quality LED bulbs that match the socket type and do not cause CANBUS errors.

## Vanity Mirror Light Battery Drain

The vanity mirror lights are a known parasitic drain source. If the vanity mirror cover is left open, the light stays on and can drain the battery. Some owners disconnect or replace these lights.
