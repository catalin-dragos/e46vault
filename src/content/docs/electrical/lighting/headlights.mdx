The E46 was available with halogen or xenon (HID) headlights depending on equipment level and model year.

## Bulb Specifications

| Function | Halogen | Xenon |

## Pre-Facelift vs. Facelift

Headlight assemblies are different between pre-facelift (1999-2002) and facelift (2003-2006) models and are not interchangeable without modification.

## Common Issues

- Lens hazing (polycarbonate lens yellows with UV exposure)
- Adjusting motor failure (xenon self-leveling)
- Condensation inside housing (check gaskets)
- Wiring connector melting (high-wattage aftermarket bulbs)
