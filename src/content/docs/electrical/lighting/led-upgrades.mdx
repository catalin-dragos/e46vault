LED upgrades improve visibility, reduce power consumption, and modernize the E46 appearance.

## Upgrade Map

| Location | OEM Bulb | LED Replacement | Notes |
|----------|----------|----------------|-------|
| License plate | Festoon 36mm | LED festoon | Easy upgrade, bright white |
| Trunk | Festoon 41mm | LED festoon | Noticeable improvement |
| Interior dome | Festoon 41mm | LED festoon | Cool white recommended |
| Footwell | W5W | LED T10 | Subtle accent lighting |
| Side markers | W5W | LED T10 | Amber or clear |
| Reverse lights | P21W | LED 1156 | Significant visibility improvement |

## CANBUS Compatibility

The E46 LCM monitors bulb current draw. Some LED bulbs draw too little current and trigger a bulb out warning. Solutions:
- Use CANBUS-compatible LED bulbs with built-in resistors
- Add external load resistors (generates heat — mount properly)
- Code the LCM to reduce bulb monitoring sensitivity

## Legal Considerations

Some LED upgrades (headlight bulbs, fog lights) may not be street-legal in all jurisdictions. Check local regulations.
