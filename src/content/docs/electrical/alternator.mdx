The E46 330 uses a Bosch 120A alternator mounted to the front of the engine, driven by the serpentine belt.

## Specifications

- **Output**: 120A (140A on some later models)
- **Manufacturer**: Bosch
- **Voltage regulator**: Internal, integrated

## Failure Symptoms

- Battery light on dashboard
- Dim headlights
- Electrical accessories acting erratically
- Battery repeatedly dying
- Whining noise from front of engine (bearing failure)

## Diagnosis

- Check output voltage at battery: should be 13.8-14.4V with engine running
- If voltage is below 13.5V or above 15.0V, the alternator or regulator is failing

## Replacement Notes

- The alternator is accessible from above the engine
- Remove the serpentine belt first
- Note the wiring connector orientation before disconnecting
- Remanufactured OE units are a cost-effective option
