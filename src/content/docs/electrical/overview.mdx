The E46 uses a distributed electrical architecture with multiple control modules communicating over CAN-bus and K-bus networks. Understanding this architecture is essential for diagnosing electrical issues.

## Key Control Modules

| Module | Abbreviation | Function |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Digital Motor Electronics | DME (MS43) | Engine management |
| Electronic Immobilizer | EWS | Anti-theft, key authentication |
| General Module | GM/ZKE | Central body electronics |
| Light Control Module | LCM | Exterior and interior lighting |
| Light Switching Center | LSZ | Headlight switch module |
| Instrument Cluster | IKE | Gauges, warning lights, trip computer |
| IHKA | IHKA | Climate control |
| ABS/DSC | ABS/DSC | Anti-lock brakes and stability |
| EGS | EGS | Automatic transmission (if equipped) |
| Rain/Light Sensor | RLS | Auto wipers and headlights |

## Communication Buses

- **CAN-bus (high speed)**: DME, EGS, ABS/DSC, instrument cluster — 500 kbit/s
- **K-bus (low speed)**: Body electronics (GM, LCM, IHKA, radio) — 9.6 kbit/s
- **D-bus (diagnostic)**: OBD-II port to gateway module

## Battery and Charging

- **Battery**: 80Ah, located in trunk (right side)
- **Alternator**: 120A (Bosch)
- **System voltage**: 12V nominal, ~14.2V with engine running
