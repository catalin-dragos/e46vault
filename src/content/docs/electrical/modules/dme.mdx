## Key Functions

- Fuel injection timing and duration
- Ignition timing per cylinder
- VANOS solenoid control
- Idle air control
- DISA valve control

- Electronic throttle control
- Fan control
- AC compressor clutch control
- Communication with EWS (immobilizer)

## Common Issues

- DME connector pin corrosion (causes intermittent faults)
- Failed DME after water intrusion into E-box
- DME must be ISN-matched to EWS for engine to start

## Programming/Coding

DME software can be updated or modified using BMW diagnostic tools (DIS/GT1, ISTA, or aftermarket tools like INPA). The DME is VIN-coded and EWS-linked.
