The EWS is BMW's electronic immobilizer system that prevents the engine from starting without an authorized key.

## How It Works

1. Key is inserted into ignition
2. EWS module reads the transponder chip in the key head
3. EWS authenticates the key ISN (Individual Serial Number)
4. EWS sends start-enabled signal to DME via rolling code
5. DME enables fuel injection and ignition

## Components

- **EWS module**: Located behind the glove box
- **Key transponder**: Passive chip in the key head
- **Ring antenna**: Around the ignition lock cylinder
- **DME link**: EWS and DME share aligned ISN codes

## Common Issues

- EWS/DME alignment lost (engine cranks but won't start, EWS light on)
- Key transponder failure (intermittent no-start)
- Ring antenna failure (EWS can't read key)

## Key Information

The E46 can store up to 10 keys. Lost key situations require EWS-DME realignment using BMW dealer tools or specialized aftermarket tools.
