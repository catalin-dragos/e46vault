The rain/light sensor (RLS) is mounted on the windshield behind the rearview mirror. It provides input for automatic wiper speed and automatic headlight activation.

## Function

- **Rain sensing**: Infrared sensor detects water droplets on the windshield
- **Light sensing**: Ambient light sensor triggers automatic headlights

## Common Issues

- Sensor detaches from windshield (adhesive failure)
- Erratic wiper behavior (dirty windshield in sensor area)
- Sensor failure after windshield replacement (incorrect installation)

## Windshield Replacement Note

When replacing the windshield, ensure the technician properly transfers the rain/light sensor gel pad to the new windshield. Improper installation causes sensor malfunction.
