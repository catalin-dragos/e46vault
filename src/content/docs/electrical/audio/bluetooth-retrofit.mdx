The E46 did not come with Bluetooth from the factory. Several retrofit options are available.

## Options

### Aftermarket Head Unit
Replace the OEM head unit with an aftermarket unit that includes Bluetooth. This is the most complete solution.

### Bluetooth Adapter Module
- **Connects to**: CD changer input on the OEM head unit
- **Function**: Streams audio via Bluetooth, some support hands-free calling
- **Installation**: Module mounts behind the head unit or in the trunk
- **Popular options**: Grom Audio, Dension, BlueMusic

### FM Transmitter
Simplest option — a Bluetooth receiver that broadcasts to an FM frequency. Audio quality is lowest of all options.

### AUX Input Adapter
Not Bluetooth, but allows a wired connection from a phone. The E46 Business CD head unit does not have a native AUX input — an adapter is required.
