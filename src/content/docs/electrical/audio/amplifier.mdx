## OEM Amplifier

The HiFi system (S676A) includes a factory amplifier located in the trunk area. Non-HiFi models drive speakers directly from the head unit.

## Aftermarket Amplifier Installation

Adding an aftermarket amplifier is the single biggest improvement to the E46 audio system.

### Signal Source
- Line-level output from aftermarket head unit (preferred)
- High-to-low level converter from OEM head unit speaker outputs

### Mounting Locations
- Under front seats (compact amps)
- Trunk wall (larger amps)
- Trunk floor

### Power Wiring
- Run a power wire from the trunk-mounted battery to the amplifier
- Use an appropriate fuse at the battery (typically 40-60A)
- Ground to a clean chassis point near the amplifier
