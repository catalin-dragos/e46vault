## OEM Navigation

The E46 Professional Navigation system uses a CD-based (later DVD-based) navigation unit with a 16:9 widescreen display integrated into the dashboard.

### Components
- Navigation computer (trunk-mounted)
- GPS antenna (rear window or shark fin)
- Widescreen display (center dashboard)
- Navigation CD/DVD disc

### Limitations
- Outdated map data (no longer updated)
- Slow route calculation
- Low-resolution display by modern standards

## Modern Alternatives

### Android Head Unit (Recommended)
Purpose-built Android head units for the E46 offer:
- Google Maps or Waze navigation
- Full touchscreen interface
- Bluetooth, CarPlay, Android Auto
- Backup camera support
- OEM-look form factor

### Smartphone Mount
The simplest solution — mount your smartphone with Google Maps or Waze. Various E46-specific mounts are available for the dashboard or air vents.
