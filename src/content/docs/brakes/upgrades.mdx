# Brake Upgrades

## Pad Upgrades (Best Value)

- **Street**: Akebono Euro Ceramic, Hawk HPS 5.0
- **Street/Track**: Hawk HP+, StopTech Sport
- **Track only**: Hawk DTC-60, Ferodo DS2500, Pagid RSL

## Stainless Steel Brake Lines

Firm up pedal feel with braided stainless lines — see Brake Lines page.

## Fluid Upgrade

- **Street**: ATE Typ 200 (higher boiling point DOT 4)
- **Track**: Motul RBF600 or Castrol SRF

## Rotor Upgrades

- **Slotted**: StopTech, Power Slot — better bite and degassing
- **Drilled**: Zimmermann cross-drilled — better cooling, risk of cracking under track use
- **Two-piece rotors**: DBA, Girodisc — lighter, better cooling
