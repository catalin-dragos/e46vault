# Parking Brake

The E46 uses a drum-in-disc parking brake system integrated into the rear rotors. The parking brake uses separate shoes inside a drum portion of the rear rotor.

## Adjustment

If the parking brake doesn't hold or requires excessive lever travel:
1. Remove rear wheels and rotors
2. Locate star wheel adjuster on backing plate
3. Turn adjuster to expand shoes until slight drag
4. Back off 3-4 clicks for clearance
5. Reinstall rotors and wheels
6. Test: Should hold on moderate hill with 4-6 clicks

## Cable Adjustment

If shoes are good but lever travel is excessive:
1. Access adjuster under center console (remove trim)
2. Loosen lock nut on cable equalizer
3. Tighten until proper lever travel achieved
4. Verify both rear wheels drag equally when engaged
