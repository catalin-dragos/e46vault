# ABS & DSC

The E46 features ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) and DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) as standard equipment on most 330 models.

## System Components

- **ABS/DSC module**: Hydraulic unit with integrated ECU (Bosch 5.7)
- **Wheel speed sensors**: One per corner, monitors rotation
- **Steering angle sensor**: Mounted on steering column
- **Yaw rate sensor**: Under center console
- **Brake pressure sensor**: In hydraulic unit

## Common Issues

### ABS/DSC Warning Light
- **Wheel speed sensor failure**: Most common cause
- **Sensor wiring damage**: Exposed wires near wheel area
- **ABS module failure**: Internal pump or valve failure
- **Steering angle sensor**: Requires calibration after steering work
- **Low brake fluid**: Triggers ABS warning

### Wheel Speed Sensor Replacement
1. Unplug sensor connector
2. Remove retaining bolt (8 Nm)
3. Pull sensor from knuckle (may be seized)
4. Clean mounting bore
5. Install new sensor, torque to 8 Nm
6. Clear codes with scan tool
