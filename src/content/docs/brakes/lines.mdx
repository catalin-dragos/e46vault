# Brake Lines & Hoses

The E46 uses a combination of rigid metal brake lines and flexible rubber hoses. The rubber hoses are a wear item and can swell under pressure, reducing brake feel.

## Inspection

- Check rubber hoses for cracks, swelling, or leaks
- Inspect metal lines for corrosion (especially in salt-belt climates)
- Look for fluid seepage at connections

## Stainless Steel Brake Line Upgrade

One of the most popular and effective brake upgrades:
- **StopTech**: DOT-compliant stainless lines
- **Goodridge**: Stainless braided, various colors
- **ECS Tuning**: Budget stainless option

Benefits:
- Firmer pedal feel
- More consistent braking
- Longer lifespan than rubber
- Improved heat resistance
