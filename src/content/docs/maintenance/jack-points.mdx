# Jack Points

Using correct jack points prevents damage to the unibody and ensures safe working conditions.

## Floor Jack Points

### Front
- **Center**: Front subframe crossmember (flat surface behind engine)
- **Side**: Reinforced jacking pad behind front wheel (pinch weld with notch)

### Rear
- **Center**: Rear differential housing (use wood block to distribute load)
- **Side**: Reinforced jacking pad ahead of rear wheel (pinch weld with notch)

## Jack Stand Points

- **Front**: Front subframe mounting points or behind jacking pad on frame rail
- **Rear**: Rear subframe mounting points or behind jacking pad on frame rail

## Important Warnings

- Never work under a car supported only by a floor jack
- Always use jack stands rated for the vehicle weight (E46 is ~3,400 lbs / 1,540 kg)
- Use wheel chocks on opposite end when jacking one end
- Work on level, solid ground only
- BMW jacking pads (Bimmian or OEM) protect pinch welds
