# DIY: Brake Pad Replacement

Brake pad replacement is one of the most common DIY jobs. The E46 330 uses 325mm front and 320mm rear ventilated rotors.

## Parts Needed
- Front brake pad set with sensor (34 11 6 761 244 or equivalent)
- Rear brake pad set with sensor (34 21 6 761 248 or equivalent)
- Brake cleaner spray

## Front Pad Procedure

1. Loosen wheel bolts, raise vehicle, remove wheel
2. Remove caliper guide pin bolts (2x 7mm Allen, 30 Nm)
3. Swing caliper up and secure with wire — do NOT hang by brake line
4. Note pad orientation and remove old pads
5. Open bleeder valve slightly, then compress piston with C-clamp
6. Close bleeder valve
7. Clean caliper bracket and slide pins with brake cleaner
8. Install new pads with wear sensor on inner pad (driver side)
9. Swing caliper down over new pads
10. Torque guide pin bolts to 30 Nm
11. Reinstall wheel, torque bolts to 120 Nm

## Rear Pad Procedure
Similar to front, with key difference:
- Rear pistons **screw in** clockwise — use rear brake piston tool
- Do NOT push straight in like front pistons

## After Installation
- Pump brake pedal several times before driving!
- Bed-in new pads: 10 moderate stops from 60 km/h, avoid hard braking for first 200 km
