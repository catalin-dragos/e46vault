# DIY: Cabin Air Filter

The E46 uses two cabin air filters (microfilters) located under the hood at the base of the windshield.

## Parts Needed
- Cabin filter set of 2 (64 31 9 071 935 or Mann CUK 3124-2)

## Procedure

1. Open hood
2. Remove cabin filter cover (3 screws or clips on cowl panel, right side)
3. Slide out old filters (note direction of airflow arrows)
4. Clean filter housing of leaves and debris
5. Insert new filters with airflow arrows pointing DOWN
6. Reinstall cover

## Tips
- Replace every 15,000 miles or annually
- Carbon-activated filters reduce odors (recommended)
- Clean housing drain holes to prevent water intrusion into cabin
- Common cause of musty HVAC smell is a dirty cabin filter
