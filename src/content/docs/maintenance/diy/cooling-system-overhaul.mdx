# DIY: Cooling System Overhaul

The M54 cooling system is the Achilles heel of the E46. A complete overhaul every 60-80k miles prevents catastrophic failure.

## Parts Needed (Full Overhaul)
- Water pump (11 53 1 437 040) — Stewart recommended
- Thermostat (11 53 7 509 227) — Wahler OE
- Expansion tank (17 13 7 543 003)
- Expansion tank cap
- Upper radiator hose (17 11 1 436 251)
- Lower radiator hose (17 12 7 510 952)
- Fan clutch (17 11 1 440 252)
- Radiator (if over 100k miles or brown)
- Coolant temperature sensor
- 8.4 liters BMW Blue coolant premix or concentrate + distilled water

## Procedure Overview

1. Drain coolant (radiator drain plug + block drain)
2. Remove fan clutch and fan (32mm, LEFT-HAND thread)
3. Remove drive belt
4. Remove fan shroud
5. Remove water pump (3 bolts, 10 Nm)
6. Install new water pump with new O-ring
7. Replace thermostat and housing gasket
8. Replace radiator hoses
9. Replace expansion tank
10. Reinstall fan clutch and belt
11. Fill and bleed cooling system
12. Pressure test system
13. Verify no leaks at operating temperature

## Bleeding the Cooling System

This is the most critical step:
1. Fill expansion tank to MAX
2. Open bleed screw on thermostat housing
3. Start engine with heater on full hot
4. Watch for air bubbles from bleed screw
5. Close bleed screw when coolant flows steadily
6. Continue topping off expansion tank
7. Let engine reach full temperature and cycle thermostat
8. Recheck level when completely cool
