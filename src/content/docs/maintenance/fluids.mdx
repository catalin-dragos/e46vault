# Fluids Guide

Using the correct fluids is critical for component longevity. The E46 uses specific fluid types that should not be substituted.

## Quick Reference

|--------|--------------|----------|
| Engine oil | 5W-30 LL-01 | 6.5L |
| Coolant | BMW Blue G48 50/50 | 8.4L |

- **Do NOT use** non-LL-01 approved engine oils
- **Always use** distilled water for coolant mixing
- **ATF**: ZF "lifetime fill" should be changed at 60k miles
