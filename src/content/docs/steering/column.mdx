# Steering Column

The E46 steering column is a collapsible safety design with tilt adjustment and connects to the steering rack via an intermediate shaft with universal joints.

## Common Issues

- **Clunking**: Worn U-joint in intermediate shaft
- **Loose tilt mechanism**: Worn pivot points
- **Steering angle sensor**: Can cause DSC faults after column work

## Intermediate Shaft / Steering Coupler

The flexible coupling (guibo/disc) in the steering shaft wears over time:
- Symptoms: Play in steering, clunking when changing direction
- Replacement requires removal of steering column lower section
- Mark shaft position before removal for correct reassembly
