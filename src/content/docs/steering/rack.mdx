# Steering Rack

The E46 uses a ZF hydraulic power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering unit mounted to the front subframe.

## Common Issues

- **Leaking seals**: Power steering fluid leak from rack boots
- **Worn inner tie rod ends**: Play in steering, wandering
- **Clunking**: Worn rack bushings or mounting

## Diagnosis

- Check for fluid leaks at rack boots
- Inspect tie rod ends for play (grab and shake)
- Check for steering wheel play with engine running
- Listen for whining (pump) vs clunking (rack/tie rods)

## Rack Mounting Torque

- Steering rack mounting bolts: 42 Nm
