# Power Steering System

The E46 uses a belt-driven hydraulic power steering pump. The fluid type varies by market — check your existing fluid color before topping off.

## Fluid Specification

- **Most USA-market E46s**: ATF Dexron III (red fluid)
- **Some cold-climate / European-market E46s**: Pentosin CHF 11S (green fluid)
- **Capacity**: ~1.0 liter
- **Never mix ATF and CHF 11S** — check existing fluid color (red = ATF, green = CHF 11S) before adding
- Check level at reservoir sight glass

## Common Issues

- **Whining pump**: Low fluid, worn pump, or air in system
- **Leaking hoses**: High-pressure and return lines deteriorate
- **Stiff steering**: Failed pump, low fluid, or belt slip
- **Fluid contamination**: Dark or burnt fluid indicates pump wear

## Power Steering Flush

1. Siphon old fluid from reservoir
2. Refill with correct fluid type (ATF Dexron III or CHF 11S — match what is already in the system)
3. Start engine, turn wheel lock-to-lock several times
4. Repeat siphon and refill 2-3 times
5. Check for correct level
