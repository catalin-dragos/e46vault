# E46 History

The BMW E46 is the fourth generation of the BMW 3 Series, produced from 1997 to 2006. It succeeded the E36 and was eventually replaced by the E90.

## Development Timeline

- **1997**: E46 sedan (323i, 328i) launched in Europe
- **1999**: E46 330i introduced with the M54B30 engine (225 hp)

- **2006**: Final production year, replaced by E90 3 Series

## Design Philosophy

The E46 was designed under Chris Bangle's leadership at BMW, though its clean, classic proportions reflect the pre-Bangle design language. It's widely considered one of BMW's best-looking 3 Series designs.

## Production Numbers

Over 3.2 million E46 3 Series were produced across all body styles, making it one of BMW's most successful models. The 330i/Ci represented the top of the non-M range, offering the best balance of performance and daily usability.

## Legacy

The E46 is considered by many enthusiasts to be the last "pure" BMW 3 Series — hydraulic power steering, naturally aspirated inline-6, balanced chassis, and communicative driving experience. It remains one of the most popular BMW platforms for enthusiasts and DIY mechanics.
