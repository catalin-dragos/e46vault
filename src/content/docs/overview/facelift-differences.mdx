# Pre-Facelift vs Facelift (LCI)

The E46 received a facelift (Life Cycle Impulse / LCI) in late 2001 for the 2002 model year (sedan) and 2003 for the coupe/convertible.

## Exterior Differences

| Component | Pre-Facelift | Facelift (LCI) |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Headlights | Separate turn signals | Integrated turn signals, clear lenses |
| Tail lights | Amber turn signals | Clear/red turn signals (sedan) |
| Front bumper | Rounded fog lights | Revised fog light shape |
| Hood | Chrome grille accent | Updated grille trim |
| Side markers | Amber | Clear (some markets) |
| Mirror indicators | None | Integrated (some models) |

## Interior Differences

| Component | Pre-Facelift | Facelift (LCI) |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Center console | Older cup holder design | Updated center console |
| Steering wheel | 3-spoke standard | Updated design |
| Climate controls | Same IHKA | Slightly revised buttons |
| Cup holders | Pop-out style | Updated design |
| OBC display | Same | Same |

## Mechanical Differences

- Both use the same M54B30 engine
- No significant mechanical changes
- Minor electronic module revisions
- Some wiring harness differences

## Mixing Parts

Most mechanical parts interchange between pre-facelift and facelift. Body panels (headlights, bumpers, tail lights) are generally NOT interchangeable without modification.

## Which to Buy?

Both are excellent. The facelift has slightly more modern styling, but pre-facelift models are often cheaper. Mechanical reliability is identical.
